{"name":"Git::Hooks","tagline":"Framework for implementing Git (and Gerrit) hooks","body":"### What's this about?\r\n\r\n[Git hooks](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks) are programs you install in Git repositories in order to augment Git's functionality.\r\n\r\nThe Git::Hooks Perl module is a framework that makes it easier to implement and use Git hooks. It comes with a set of plugins already implementing useful functionality for you to make sure your commits comply with your project policies. As a Git user or a Git server administrator you probably don't need to implement any hooks for most of your needs, just to enable and configure some of the existing plugins.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\nThe main module documents its [usage](https://metacpan.org/pod/Git::Hooks#USAGE) indetail. Each plugin is implemented as a separate module under the <code>Git::Hooks::</code> namespace. The [Git::Hooks distribution](https://metacpan.org/release/Git-Hooks) comes with a set of plugins and you can find more on [CPAN](https://metacpan.org/search?q=module%3AGit%3A%3AHooks).\r\n\r\nFor a gentler introduction you can try our [tutorial](https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/Git-Hooks/lib/Git/Hooks/TUTORIAL.pod) which has sections for [Git users](https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/Git-Hooks/lib/Git/Hooks/TUTORIAL.pod#USER-TUTORIAL), [Git administrators](https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/Git-Hooks/lib/Git/Hooks/TUTORIAL.pod#ADMIN-TUTORIAL), and [Gerrit administrators](https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/Git-Hooks/lib/Git/Hooks/TUTORIAL.pod#GERRIT-TUTORIAL).\r\n\r\n<h3>\r\n<a id=\"installation\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#installation\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"octicon octicon-link\"></span></a>Installation</h3>\r\n\r\nGit::Hooks is installed like any other Perl module. It's easier to use a CPAN client, such as <code>cpanm</code> or <code>cpan</code>, so that dependencies are installed automatically:\r\n\r\n    $ cpanm Git::Hooks\r\n    $ cpan Git::Hooks\r\n\r\nYou can even use it directly from a clone of its Git repository. All you have to do is to tell Perl where to find it by using this in your scripts:\r\n\r\n    use lib '/path/to/clone/of/git-hooks/lib';\r\n    use Git::Hooks;\r\n\r\n\r\n### Getting Help\r\nThe best way to ask questions or to report problems is to file an issue at [GitHub](https://github.com/gnustavo/Git-Hooks/issues).\r\n\r\n### Copyright &amp; License\r\nGit::Hooks is copyright (c) of [CPqD](http://www.cpqd.com.br).\r\n\r\nThis is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the same terms as the Perl 5 programming language system itself. About the only thing you can't do is pretend that you wrote code that you didn't.\r\n\r\n### Enjoy!\r\nGustavo Chaves <gnustavo@cpan.org>\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
